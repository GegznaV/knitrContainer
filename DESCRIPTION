Title: Print `pander`, `plotly` and other objects from inside a loop in `R Markdown`
Description: `knitrContainer` is an R package designed to collect objects
             and print them in `R Markdown`.
             Some objecs such as `pander` tables and `plotly` plots, are not
             printed from insite loop in `R Markdown` in a regular way.
             `knitrContainer` solves this problem.
             An object used by `knitrContainer` can be any object, that is
             includable in R list an that is printable, such as objects,
             ptintable with `pander`, text, as well as `ggplot2`, `plotly`
             plots, etc.
