Title: Collect and print `pander`, `plotly` and other objects in a `knitr` report
Description: `knitrContainer` is an R package designed to collect objects
             to list-type container and print them in a `knitr` report.
             WHY? Some objecs such as `pander` tables and `plotly` plots, are not
             printed from insite loop of `knitr` reports in a regular way.
             `knitrContainer` solves this problem by providing fuctions to
             get these objects printed and included in `HTML` files.
             WHAT OBJECTS? An object used by `knitrContainer` can be any object,
             that is includable in R list an that is printable, such as objects,
             printable with `pander`, text, as well as `ggplot2`, `plotly`
             plots, etc.
