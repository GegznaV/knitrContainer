Title: Collect and Print Multiple Objects in a `Knitr` R Markdown Report
Description: The purpose of `knitrContainer` is to collect objects (especially
             those which are genereted in loops) to a list-type container and
             print them in a `knitr`/ R Markdown report.
             WHY? Some objects such as `pander` tables and `plotly` plots, are not
             printed from inside a loop and are not displayed in `knitr` reports.
             `knitrContainer` solves this problem by providing convenience
             functions to get these objects printed and included in `HTML` files.
             WHAT OBJECTS? An object used by `knitrContainer` can be any object,
             that is includible in R list, such as text/strings, objects printable
             with `pander`, as well as `ggplot2` and `plotly` plots, etc.
